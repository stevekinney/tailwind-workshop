# Tailwind's Layers

In Tailwind CSS, the concept of "[layers](./layer-directive.md)" is used to control the generated CSS's order in a way that optimizes for efficient file size and specificity. The idea is to minimize conflicts between utility classes, base styles, and component styles. Tailwind defines three primary layers: `base`, `components`, and `utilities`.

[Layers](./layer-directive.md) aren't Tailwind-specific. They're a new-ish CSS feature.

## The Short Version

Tailwind ships with three layers:

- `base`: Basic styles for raw HTML elements (e.g. `h1`).
- `components`: Common styles for reusable components (e.g. `.btn` or `.card`).
- `utilities`: Super specific one-off utilities like setting the margin for a particular elements.

## The Longer Version

### Base Layer (`base`)

The base layer is where you'd find the foundational styles that are applied to raw HTML elements. These are low-specificity selectors that include default browser styling, and you generally don't modify these styles directly. In a Tailwind project, the base layer is commonly populated by using the `@layer base {}` directive to include any custom base styles or overrides.

Example:

```css
@layer base {
	h1 {
		@apply text-2xl;
	}
	p {
		@apply text-base;
	}
}
```

### Components Layer (`components`)

The components layer comes next and is where you define common design patterns as reusable components, typically by applying utility classes with Tailwind's `@apply` directive. These components are higher in specificity compared to base styles but lower than utility classes.

Components are often expressed in your CSS files using the `@layer components {}` directive. Here is an example:

```css
@layer components {
	.btn {
		@apply rounded bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2 text-white;
	}
	.card {
		@apply rounded p-4 shadow-md;
	}
}
```

### Utilities Layer (`utilities`)

The utilities layer is where Tailwind's utility classes are generated. These are highly specific, single-purpose classes that do one thing (like setting margin, padding, text alignment, etc.). This layer is intended to be the highest specificity layer, effectively overriding any conflicting styles from the previous layers.

You generally do not modify the utilities layer directly, as Tailwind automatically generates it based on your configuration. Here is an example of some utility classes:

```css
.mt-4 {
	margin-top: 1rem;
}

.text-center {
	text-align: center;
}
```

### How They Differ

1. **Specificity**: Base styles have the lowest specificity, followed by components, and then utilities have the highest. This ensures that utility classes can override other styles when needed.
2. **Purpose**: Base styles target raw HTML elements and set foundational styles. Components are reusable design patterns made from utility classes. Utilities are single-purpose, highly specific classes generated by Tailwind.
3. **Customization**: Base and component layers can be easily extended or customized using Tailwind's `@apply` directive and `@layer` directives, while utilities are generally generated based on your Tailwind config.
4. **Order in Generated CSS**: The layers are ordered such that base styles come first in the generated CSS file, followed by components, and utilities come last.
