# Grid Area Templates

In Tailwind CSS, the concept of Grid area templates allows you to define how grid items should be placed across rows and columns within a grid container. While Tailwind doesn't provide a direct utility for defining grid template areas, it does offer utilities to place individual items into named grid areas, similar to how you would with native CSS `grid-template-areas`.

## Grid Area Utilities

To place an item in a named grid area, you can use the `grid-area-[name]` utility. This is particularly useful when you have a complex layout, and you've already defined grid areas in your CSS using the `grid-template-areas` property.

```css
.container {
	grid-template-areas:
		'header header'
		'sidebar main'
		'footer footer';
}
```

In Tailwind, you can then place items like so:

- For an item to occupy the 'header' grid area, you'd use `grid-area-header`.
- For the 'sidebar', `grid-area-sidebar`.
- For the 'main' area, `grid-area-main`.
- And so on.

## When to Use Grid Area Templates

Use grid area templates when you have complex layouts that would benefit from a more semantic setup, or when the position of grid items needs to change based on different screen sizes or other conditions.

## Trade-offs

One trade-off of using named grid areas is that it makes your grid layout dependent on the external CSS where you define the grid template areas. This might slightly deviate from the utility-first approach of Tailwind.
